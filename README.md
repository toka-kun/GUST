## What is this?

GUST is a full-featured web proxy that lives entirely inside a single HTML file, allowing you to use it without any setup, hosting, or terminal access. It was built by the Nautilus Labs team to be a replacement for every single other proxy out there, and to put an end to school blocked proxies once and for all. 

---

## Why schools can't block it 

Every single web proxy out there relies on something called a **Service Worker**, a background script that intercepts network requests before they reach the browser. It's an integral part of any other web proxy you use, allowing the proxy to communicate with its server and proxy your requests, but Service Workers ALWAYS require a live server to function. That means traditional proxies only work when hosted at a specific URL. Block that URL, and the proxy is dead. You're probably already familiar with the cat-and-mouse game between you and your admin, where someone makes a link, it gets used for a day or two, then gets blocked.

School network filters, admin installed extensions (think Securly,  Lightspeed Systems, Securly, Linewize, Blocksi, etc.) and admin-controlled browsers (like Chromebook MDM policies) are very good at exactly this. Your school maintains blocklists, with specific sites added every day to this list of sites you can't access. Many filtering extensions also have more advanced features, where they read a links metadata to detect proxy patterns and automatically add them to the blocklist. An even higher number of these extensions control what can run in the background, which is a big achilles heel for every single current proxy site available. 
GUST doesn't use Service Workers at all. Heres what we came up with instead:

Instead, it uses **libcurl.js**, a full HTTP library compiled to WebAssembly, to make requests directly through a WebSocket tunnel called the WISP protocol. (Thanks to Mercury Workshop for these) The entire proxy engine runs as plain JavaScript inside a single HTML file. This means:

- ✅ **It can run as a local file** (`file://`), with no server and no domain to block
- ✅ **It can be hosted anywhere static files work**: GitHub Pages, Vercel, Netlify, a USB drive, a Google Doc, a Google Site, etc.
- ✅ **It can be hosted on JSDelivr or CDN sites**, because the site can be loaded through one SVG file
- ✅ **It has no Service Worker to kill**, because it never registered one
- ✅ **It survives tab crashes and memory pressure**, cause it has no background worker to lose
- ✅ **It can be renamed, embedded in an iframe, or wrapped in another HTML file**, giving the filter nothing to latch onto
- ✅ **It can be copy-pasted into any WYSIWYG HTML editor on the web**, because again, it's just HTML with CSS and JS inlined
- ✅ **It can be compiled into a blob: or data: url and opened that way**, again, HTML

The short version: most blockers can only block URLs. GUST is a file. You can't block a file without obliterating a cruical part of the student user experience, and even if they take that drastic step, well, HTML can be hosted or opened in litrally anything. It's the frame of the world wide web. no more whack-a-mole, cat-and-mouse game of finding unblocked links and your school blocking them!

## How it works

When you type a URL, GUST fetches the entire page through a WebAssembly HTTP client, rewrites every resource URL, injects a proxy runtime script, and renders the result in a sandboxed iframe. It's important to note that the iframe is purely for sandboxing, and the sites you visit inside GUST have alreayd beenIn a standard, low-quality proxy, an iframe is used to simply point to another URL (e.g., <iframe src="[https://blocked-site.com](https://blocked-site.com)">). This fails immediately because the school filter sees the request to the blocked domain and kills it. Inside GUST, GUST fetches raw data through a Wisp tunnel and scrubs the code to redirect every link and resource back to itself, it injects that modified payload into the iframe as a sandboxed environment. This ensures the proxied site can run its own scripts and styles without breaking the GUST interface or leaking your real activity to the network filter, and ensures the only request filters can see is a request to the Wisp server. Here's what that looks like step by step:

<img width="1440" height="1178" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c2cbd934-4c5f-4341-95ae-190c9f66d828" /><br>


Every page GUST loads gets a small script injected before anything else runs. This script intercepts virtually every way a page can try to escape the proxy: `location.href`, `window.open`, form submissions, `XMLHttpRequest`, `fetch`, `WebSocket`, `Worker`, `EventSource`, history API pushes, anchor clicks, and even the Navigation API used by modern SPAs. It also spoofs `document.cookie`, `localStorage`, `sessionStorage`, and IndexedDB so pages behave as if they're on their real origin. All network traffic also flows through a WISP WebSocket server, so your real IP is never exposed to the sites you visit. The WISP server acts as a TCP/TLS relay, and the destination server only ever sees the relay's address, not yours. You can self-host a WISP server or use a public one, and GUST supports server switching in settings.

## How the SVG works

As you know, GUST was built to run in a single HTML file. With this logic, we can split the assets to fit in their own files, being CSS and JS respectively. Then, we use foreign objects in a .svg file to load the HTML inside the SVG, also utilizing the HTML schema used for SVGs. Finally, we make sure that all content is XML safe before being loaded, which prevents errors during JavaScript execution.

## Getting started

**Option 1:  Just open the file**

Download `index.html` and open it in any modern browser. That's it. That's the whole setup.

**Option 2: Host it**

Drop `index.html` on any static host. GitHub Pages, Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, your university's free web hosting that's been running since 2003. They all work fine.

**Option 3: Embed it**

Put it inside another HTML file as an `<iframe>`. Works from a Blob URL. Works from a data URI (though large). Basically works from anywhere.

| **x8rr** | Ported GUST to SVG, Bug reports, feedback, light assistance, and the parts of this README |
| **Mercury Workshop** | Created the WISP protocol, the WebSocket tunneling layer that makes this all possible |
| **ading2210** | Built libcurl.js, which is curl compiled to WebAssembly (absolute clutchup) |
| **Mozilla Foundation** | PDF.js, honestly dude I can't write an entire PDF handler thats just too much and this already exists |

## Known bugs and limitations

- Some complex web features can't be fully proxied: native WebSockets from within a page, WebRTC (intentionally blockable via settings), and service workers inside proxied pages
- Some links can't be followed inside GUST. For now just drag the link to the omnibox :/.
- The language/spellcheck feature is listed in settings and labeled `[BROKEN]`. We know. It'l be fixed eventually
- Very JavaScript-heavy SPAs may have edge cases in navigation interception.
